# Counter Dapp 


- counter.sol which will be our solidity contract, 
- counter.js which will consist of our deployment code
- counter.html which will connect to the contract using web3js



counter.sol 

```
So in counter.sol we have 3 functions and one public variable which maintains the counter.
By Default, a contract state is read-only unless it is specified as public, so we have made all the functions public.
