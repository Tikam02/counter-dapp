// The next 2 variables i.e bytecode and abi are the files that were built during the compilation of .sol script. The ABI is a .json file that describes the deployed contract and its functions. It allows us to contextualize the contract and call its functions.bin is simply a compact binary representation of the compiled bytecode. The opcodes arenâ€™t referenced by PUSH, PULL or DELEGATECALL, but their binary representations, which look like random numbers when read by a text editor.
