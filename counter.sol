// So in counter.sol we have 3 functions and one public variable which maintains the counter.
// By Default, a contract state is read-only unless it is specified as public, so we have made all the functions public.


// The view functions are read-only functions, which ensures that state variables cannot be modified after calling them. As the display() function wonâ€™t be modifying the variable, it is kept to view function.
